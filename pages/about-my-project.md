subtitle: CEAMLS AI SUMMER 2025
project_title: "Application of Artifical Intellligence (AI) to predict genetic biomaarkers of brain tumor from Transcriptomic data set."

problem: |
  There are programmes out there that do a good job in anlyzing healthcare issues, but unfortunately cancer remains and seems like an unpredictable healthcare issue, with little to no evidence or patterns on how to prevent or track cancerous brain tumor cells before they full develop or even start becoming cancerous cells.

  This project seeks to describe the AI/ML and/or tools to be used and their appications in the project, this project would require the use of different machine learning algorithms such as Random forest, Naive bates , support  vector machine (SVM), K - nearest neighbors (KNN), LASSO, and Ridge..

approach: |
  The project follows a weekly research schedule pipeline:

  - Mandatory Virtual Bootcamp/Orientation
  - Practice python, pandas, jupyter notebook,numpy, and matplotlib
  - Basic understanding of Genomics, statistical analysis, graphs and plots.
  - Introduction to machine learning - supervised and unsupervised
  - Mandatory Mid-Summer Presentations (6/27)
  - Deep Learning FUndamentals and Neural Network
  - Project work - Apply the concepts and techniques in RNA-seg data sets
  - Project work - Develop and evaluate the performance of the ML model
  - Improvement/Demonstrations/model tuning/ preparation
  - Mandatory End of Summer Research Symposium (7/31)
outcome: |
  By the end of the program, the project will result in a working prototype of an application that should be able to predict genetic biomarkers of brain tumor from transcriptomic data set, providing more understanding on how to deal tumors on a larger scale
  Additionally I will gain experience in data gathering, machine learning, and deep learning techniques for transcriptomic data sets, such as finding anf collecting data from different sources and concatenating them.
