  bio: |
    I‚Äôm currently a sophomore pre-nursing student studying Nursing at Morgan State University in Baltimore, Maryland. I expect to graduate in 2028.

    My work is a vital profession in healthcare, focused on providing patient care, administering treatments, and supporting medical teams. As a nursing student i get to work in hospitals, clinics and community settings ensuring patient well-being through compassionate and skilled care.

    When I‚Äôm not working on research, I enjoy making and listening to music, practicing my videography, cinematography and video editing skills in my free time.
