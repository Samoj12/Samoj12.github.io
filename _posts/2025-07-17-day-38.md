what_i_learned: |
  Today we finishe up the writing work show that we started last week thursday which really was needed, it really helped me realizes certain aspects to write about or review before submitiing the final paper which is very helpful and all, I really like the professor that came to tech us, she is very pleasant and tries to make all of us participate which is very helpful, we also had the opportunity to play a kahoot game just to test our knowledge to make sure we get and understand all she has been teaching us since last week. After lunch my group and I continued to edit and add to the research paper on overleaf, we also had time to review previously reviewed research papers and new papers as well thanks to the hard work of my dear co-workers.

  No blockers.

  I and my group are just working on the write up because our mentor gave us a due date on monday so we can have time to run a practice session and also to correct any misconception or mistakes we might have made during the writing of the paper.
