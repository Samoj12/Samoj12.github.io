what_i_learned: |
  Today, I focused and learnt about what biomarkers are; they are unique markers found in cancerous tumors or tumors, futhermore, Genomic biomarkers are measureable characteristics of either RNA or DNA that signal normal or abnormal biological processes, responses to an exposure or intervention 
  For example: you could picture it as a name tag only with more details of what cell or tumor it was gotten from, and what makes it unique, basically helps us to understand what type of cell,tissue or tumor type it is.
  A brief definition of what transcriptomic data set is; the systemic measurements of many RNAs, futhermore, it is a study which employs RNA sequencing to identify differentially expressed genes and alternatively splicing effects by comparing gene expression profiles between healthy and diseased tissues.

  Trying not to get carried away with other information and pin pointing and focusing on what the project wishes to achieve.
reflection: |
  There is still much research to do and more transcriptomic data sets to find and to clean, understaning the biological theoretical aspect would help to point my team in the right direction.
