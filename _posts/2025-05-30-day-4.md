what_i_learned: |
  Today, I learnt the introduction on Generative AI and LLMS, a brief history about computer and their evolution over 80 years from being just glorified calculators to advanced powerful tools that make work effecient and faster, I learnt about prompt engineering, I also concluded my introduction to python programming 101 today.
  I got to understand that initial use of computers were to just do basic mathematical computation, being web servers and several engines, programmin and compiling but thanks to remodelling and research, the evolution is defineitely evidential.
  I learnt the various parts of conditions in algorithm decisions, the use boolean data type, relational operators and logical operators.
  I also participated in a various number of kahoot on the various topics I learnt in class, from the introduction of python programming to generative AI and LLMS and a slide identification of Images telling if it were AI generated or not. I also created a song using an AI tool.
blockers: |
  The projects I was given in my python class to build a student grade evaluator with the use of conditional and logical operators, the concept seemed easy at first but the implimentation was really tasking.
reflection: |
  I thought programming would be very difficult especially when you are basically learning a new language but i realized it is all about patience and paying attention to instructions and steps, I also had fun during the kahoot session, a nice way to learn and relax too.
