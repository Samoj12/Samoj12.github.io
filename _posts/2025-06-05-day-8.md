what_i_learned: |
  Today, we had a tour around Morgan State University, though I am a student, but it was still refreshing and nice to check out the whole school becuase I haven't had the time to check out some buildings like the engineering building, communication building and CEBEIS building because of my tight class schedules.
  I also learnt about the use of while loop, which is basically used to repeat particular codes till it has been asked to break.
  I also tried applying the use of the while loop with if, elif and else statements also with the use of variables to try to create a guessing game of sort.
blockers: |
  My major blocker is the while loop usage, I don't seem to have grab the concept well because my code kept on asking the question even after giving the write number.
reflection: |
  I need to really buckle up, study more and practice more because the understanding of the while loop is an essential in python programming and without it I might not be able to move on. Also I have to complete a python course on kaggle tomorrow as tomorrow is the due date our mentor gave us.
