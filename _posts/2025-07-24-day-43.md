what_i_learned: |
  Today, Our faculty mentor came in to see how we've been doing and how far we have come with the project and I think he was pleased, he did make some correction snand some suggestions on the write up mainly but we were in the right track, particularly on the Abstract, Methodology, and Conclusion. He said the Abstract is meant to be a summary of the whole paper where we would address the issue, what we did in the methodology or what method we used to solve the issue, and finally what our result was. Also he made a grammatic correction on it being in past tense and in third person passive. So I would be making those necessary changes and correction. I also completed the editing of our Elevator pitch video/ Skit which the whole team liked, the original fear was it won't come out good and all but thankfuly it came out better than expected.

  No blockers.

reflection: |
  At this junction we are already done with everything, just a few correction to attend to and we are all done, next we can move on to preparing for the final sympodium next week, we should be able to come up with a rough draft of slides to present then we practice on our presentation to give us more confidence and bring down any nervousness we might have.
