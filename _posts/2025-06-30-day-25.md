  Today, the whole team worked on tweaking a prototype project code for cancer prediction using gene expression data, which the project is quite similar to our project, basically we applied the same knowledge and set of codes to our code, together with the clean datasets we all worked on, thanks to the guidance of Tije and Skylar we were able to refine the project, although we are not done but we are making progress I trained my model with random forest classifier which took about 20mins which was not too bad, Skylar ran a model but it was not random forest which took about 45mins. The team also reviewed a paper Dr. Roshan sent over the weekend, together we were able to get some valuable intel like **feature selection/feature extraction ** which are both dimensionality reduction techniques used in machine learning, but they differ in their approach. Feature selection chooses a subset of the original features, keeping their original meaning, while feature extraction creates new features from combinations of the original features, often transforming the data into a new feature space.

  No blockers today.
 
reflection: |
  Today a bit weird at first just because anytime we were making progress, it seems we diverted a bit away from the main object or the programme we are trying to run does not work or give us exactly what we need which is honestly head aching but that is what researching is all about, trying every technique till we achieve a result or at least something close. Tomorrow we would be continuing with the tweaking of this project, hopefully we would be getting closer to what we are actually looking for, we would also be practicing our presentation in preparation to the mid summer sympodium.
