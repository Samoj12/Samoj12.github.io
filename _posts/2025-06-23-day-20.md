  Today, I started researching the in depth of Brain tumor grade levels which usually range from 1 to 4, 1 being the slow growth and less harmful stage of any tumor and 4 being the rapid growth and most aggressive level, I got to determine the grade of the types of tumors I stated last week, Under Gliomas; we have Astrocytoma, Oligodendroglioma and Ependymoma and under these sub types,For the astrocytoma - we have Grade 1 Astrocytoma, Grade 2 Diffused Astrocytoma, Grade 3 Anaplastic Astrocytoma and Glioblastoma. For the Oligodendroglioma - basically a slow growing could be in the Grade 2. For the Ependymoma - we have Grade 1 (Subependymomas and Myxopapillary), Grade 2 Ependymoma and Grade 3 Anaplastic Ependymomas. For the Meningioma - it is basically a slow growing tumor which is classified as a Grade 2. For the Pituitary Adenoma - Slow growing tumor which is also a Grade 2.

  The major blocker for the day was the heat wave, the temperature was 97 degrees, it felt like I was in an oven, then the changing of venue was very necessary and helpful. Shout out to Michael and Dr. Naja for the rescue.

  So far, there is progress once again despite starting the whole data search and cleaning again from the begining, my group seems to be in a good sync we divided the work flow and we are making good time, we also took a look at the template for the upcoming mid presentation, we would be able to definitely present a tangible report on how far we've come. This program has helped me to push passed my limits and uncover so much knowledge even in my field of study.
