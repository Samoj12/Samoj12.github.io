what_i_learned: |
  Today, we did a tutorial on save and load Trained model using pickle and sklearn joblib in machine learning.
  Solving problems with machine learning consist of the training model and test model by asking questions. It is also established that the more the size of the data used to train the model, the better the better the model becomes.
  One of the differences between using the pickle and sklearn joblib is that sklearn joblib can accomodate large numpy arrays internally on objects. While pickle can also do the same thing, it is prefered that sklearn joblib is more effecient.
  
  blockers: |
  I was unable to install the sklearn joblib, so I couldn't work on it.
reflection: |
  I seem to be understanding the basics of python programming and how to apply them to exercises given by my mentor ,although I still have some iss.
