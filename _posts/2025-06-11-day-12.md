what_i_learned: |
  Today, we did a tutorial on save and load Trained model using pickle and sklearn joblib in machine learning.
  Solving problems with machine learning consist of the training model and test model by asking questions. It is also established that the more the size of the data used to train the model, the better the better the model becomes.
  One of the differences between using the pickle and sklearn joblib is that sklearn joblib can accomodate large numpy arrays internally on objects. While pickle can also do the same thing, it is prefered that sklearn joblib is more effecient.
  I also learnt what an accurate research paper would require which are; **Abstract** ( a concised summary that typically serves to provide an overview of the research's main objective, methods, results and conclusions.), **Introduction** ( the begining of every paper which presents the topic, some background in formation, and the research question or thesis statement.), **Methodology** ( basically what approach was used during the research which could be in quality, quantity, mixed or through observation/case study.), **Result / Conclusion** ( a crucial part of a research paper which presents the main findings derived from the data collection and analysis.)

  I was unable to install the sklearn joblib, so I couldn't work on it, learning the pickle method of the save and load trained model gave me a bit of issues, but slowly I am getting it.
reflection: |
  So far I have been thriving in the literature review because it has to deal with more of reading and researching on brain tumors and genetics which I find very much interesting.
