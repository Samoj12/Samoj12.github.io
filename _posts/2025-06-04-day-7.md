  Today, I focued on kaggle python course for some basic python knowledge where I relearnt functions and conditions.
  I learnt how to use for, else and elif in python programming, we also solved a task using the boolean data types, trying differnet scenerios of the if and else data type with ranges, I also learn how to use AND.
  I also got to understand some concepts on user input, conditionals, loops, functions, lists, 2D lists, dictionaries, sets, OOP which means object oriented programming, and list comprehension.
  I was able to complete two courses in the kaggle python programming course which were Hello Python (A quick introduction to python syntax, variable assignment, and numbers) and Functions and Getting Help (Calling functions and defining our own, and using python's builtin documentation).
  I also started the 3rd lesson which is Booleans and conditionals (Using booleans for branching logic).

  There is progress in my python programming, learning different functions to solve problems and apply the logic to day to day activities. I also completed 2 parts out of 7 sub courses in the kaggle python programming course.
