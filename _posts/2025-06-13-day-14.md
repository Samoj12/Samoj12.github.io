what_i_learned: |
  Today, I was assigned to preparing an introduction for the research paper which would be basically containing the:
  Background and context of Brain Tumors: What brain tumor is and it's history, what are genetic biomarkers and their importance, Introduction of transcriptomic data, the molecular mechanisms and signaling pathways. explanation of how these pathways affect cell cycle regulation, apoptosis, and therapy resistance, the current documented diagnosis as well as the treatment challenges, Role of AI and machine learning and finally transitioning into our methods, methodology and thesis statement.
  Thanks to my mentor I was able to get all these areas that I could do research on and make a valid and strong introduction on.
  I got to understand that Glioblastomas are cancerous, Glioblastoma stem cells are derived from the Glioblastome tumor which could also be refered to as a tumor or a part/section of a tumor.
  I also learnt there are stem cells that aren't part of the tumor but could also contribute to the development of the tumor such as Neural Stem Cells which are self-renewing cells between the brain and spinal cord.
blockers: |
  Today's blocker was getting enough and accurate sources for the research paper, trying to structure them well for a research paper and presentation.
reflection: |
  I got more information on Brain tumors and biomarkers, there is so much research sources but it takes time to sit and go through each one to actually get a good referenc to what our project is trying to accomplish.
