what_i_learned: |
  Today, we had our weekly meet up with other teams but we did a writing workshop, which is basically helping to effeciently write up papers for our research during this program, I learnt about the fundamentals of writing a research paper, which are Professionalism - which entails being formal and using positive language. Accuracy - which includes key vocabulary, format, content, methodology. Clarity - which is how well what the paper is trying to say is well communicated to whomever it might be communicating to. Completeness - is simply using all the previous steps to make a good write up. After our break, where we returned to our designated labs to get back to work, my group had a short discussion on what is left to do, which is to get a model to give us a higher accuracy and to finish up the write up. We also made a new discovery from our mentors explanation on how he used the t-SNE technique and XGBOOST model. He was able to help us narrow down a few genes that were upregulated and down regulated, then I and Mr. Richard did more research to discover research papers to confirm our claims on some certain genes being less expressed or highly expressed and how their presence after tumors.

reflection: |
  Time seems to going by fast, another day has come to an end and we are one step closer to rounding up this project, despite not having prior knowledge to what this project or institute entailed, this has been a really exciting, creative , fun, empowering and educative time for me, I have gained alot of knowledge on programming language, artificial intelligence optimisation for human use and a new perspective on a potential career path.
