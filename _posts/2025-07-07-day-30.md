what_i_learned: |
  Today was a cool day, the presentation we had last week really helped us to have more confidence in ourselves and projects, and I got to have an over view of everyone's project, for our project have made alot of progress, the main things we just need to work on now is getting more data to have a broader datasets, working on the research paper on overleaf and finally re running the models we have tried to see if the increment of the datasets will make the models to perform well and give us a better accuracy. Today I and the team worked on Kaggle and GEO to find more datasets for our program, we found some but could not use it because of the file type it was in, I tried converting it to csv file types but unfortunately it was giving some weird signs, I spoke to my mentor and group about it but we just decided to let those ones go, Skylar also taught us how to clean and merge datasets after finding the unclean data, I also helped Ato and Arpana in labeling of tumors to benign and malignant through the tumor type or grade level.

  Finding the same datasets that we've found or used before, which tells their are limited datasets to the project which we wish to make.
 
reflection: |
  Today was calm, and I think it's going to be like this for the rest of the weeks we have here, we just have a few things to find, add, correct, fix and write then the project should be done, we also have to prepare for our final display and presentation. I will work on making the introduction look good on the overleaf and continue to assist my team members in the best possible way I can.
