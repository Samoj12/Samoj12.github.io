what_i_learned: |
  Today, we reviewed the codes for our project with Tije. We used his prototype as a case study which happens to have the highest accuracy so far with no issues in the codes. He first imported all the necessary libraries he had to import like pandas, numpy, matplotlib.pyplot, seaborn, sklearn.model_selection, train_test_split, sklearn.preprocessing, LabelEncoder, label_binarize, MinMaxScaler, mutual_info_classif, e.t.c. Then processeds to importing the datasets, gets the shape (rows and columns), uses describe the datasets to know the mean and standard deviation, then he normalizes the data instead of scaling it with the count per million, after that he applies the Log 2 FC and FDR for adjustment then trains the model. Unfortunately my results are all over the place which is not giving any sensible interpretation. I would go back and review it and seem if I can get it to give me the appropriate result like the result my mentor got.

  Trying to apply my mentors method, not being able to compute in the Log 2 FC and FDR afyer the cpm normalization
 
reflection: |
  I need to review my codes because i tried to replicate this version of my mentors code to see if I could get his accuracy or even surpass it, currently my highest accuracy is at 79 with XGBOOST but with his, it is at 83. I ran into an issue with my Log 2FC and FDR but hopefully I would be able to resolve it with my mentor tomorrow. I also tried the volcano plot and it did not come out as expected due to the fact that the Normalization did not normalize well and my application of the Log 2 FC is wrong.
