what_i_learned: |
  Today we had a cohort connect which basically compromised of each individual and team where we applied the VARK test and Myers-Briggs test which basically told us each of our preferred learning style: visual, aural, read/write or kinesthetic and identifying personality preferences across four dichotomies. Extraversion (E) vs. Introversion (I): How you gain and direct energy. Sensing (S) vs. Intuition (N): How you gather and process information. Thinking (T) vs. Feeling (F): How you make decisions. Judging (J) vs. Perceiving (P): How you deal with structure and organization. I also discovered I was more of a Aural and Kinesthetic learner than a visual, read and write learner. Kinesthetic learning, also known as tactile learning, is a style of learning where individuals absorb information best through physical activities rather than passive methods like listening to lectures or watching demonstrations. An aural learner is someone who learns best through hearing and listening. They typically prefer to listen to lectures rather than take notes and may excel in speaking and acting. We also had a small presentation on what each group members learning type was.

  No blockers.

reflection: |
  It was a lovely time at todays cohort and was lowkey needed because I think everyone feels burn out and all. I and my team also had a discussion and presentation on everyone's result on our different methods to the project. and It seems the highest accuracy we do have is greater than 80 percent. We might have to leave it at that because nothing else seems to be changing it, and we have to also properly complete the research paper on overleaf. We gradually rounding up.
