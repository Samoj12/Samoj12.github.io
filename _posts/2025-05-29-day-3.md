what_i_learned: |
  Today, I learnt about computer vision from a guest scholar (Andrew Kelly), Computer vision is simply the teaching of a computer to understand and analyze a particular image, subject or object.
  I also learnt about the image classification which has to deal with the categorizing of different objects in images, Object detection which identifies and localizes multiple objects in an image, Object tracking which is the locating and following of one or more objects across successive frames in a video, Image segmentation which divides an image into multiple meaningful regions.
  The way computer vision works is through seeing with the cameras, breaking down the images, finding patterns
  I made also learnt how to use a python library and computer vision model (YOLOV8) on Google collab.
  I also continued my lesson on introduction to python programming, I learnt about types of casting, conversion of integers to strings, variales and how to use them 
blockers: |
  No blockers, the step by step session helped me to assimulate better.
reflection: |
  I thought programming would be very difficult especially when you are basically learning a new language but i realized it is all about patienc and paying attention to instructions and steps
