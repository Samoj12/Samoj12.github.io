what_i_learned: |
  Today, I finished up the discussion section where i added a few more genes like the H4C14, ANXA1 and CHI3L1 which were also part of our top 10 most expressed genes, although the H4C14 seems to be a very interesting one because it hasn't been really talked about, or researched, so it is a possibility that we have uncovered a novel potential biomarker in malignant brain tumors which is very fascinating. We also successfully executed the elevator pitch video, I took it upon myself to edit the clips because that is what I love doing plus it would be a very cool avenue to learn more because I have not made an edit for an educational purpose.Hopefully it would come out well and unique.

  No blockers.

reflection: |
  We are very much done we just need to make a few edits to our research paper write up then we should be all good, our faculty mentor seems to be coming in tomorrow just to do a final check in with us and to make sure everything is good with the upcoming sympodium and our delivarables.
