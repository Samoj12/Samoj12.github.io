what_i_learned: |
  Today we resumed our in person welcome and introduction to the institue, I got to meet alot of my peers and faculty mentor in person, I got to learn more about the implication artificial intelligence has in the world, the fact it's ever evolving is both a good and concerning thing, it definetly makes work easier and faster but would render some workers jobless at the end of the day because the effeiciency of it's work is truely impressive and less time consuming than what a regular person would use an extensive amount of time.
  I also got to learn from my faculty mentor what the research would ultimately require the team to accomplish or achieve which is: **To Predict Genetic Biomarkers Of Brain Tumor**, by developing and teaching a machine learning module to get the difference and comparisons in genes of controlled variables (healthy genes) and experimental variables (diseasesd genes).
blockers: |
  The blocker was the fact that I am not a computer science major which is limiting when it comes to my coding knowledge but thankfully my mentors are willing to help me with materials, teaching me the essentials and basics of python and machine learning.
reflection: |
  It is exciting to get into a research program where I get to learn and apply my knowledge on computer science and biology, I also discovered I need to brush up on my knowledge of Genetics for the purpose of understanding the project more and to be able to explain to other individuals about the research which could push the health care sector one step ahead in the studies of cancerous cells relating to brain tumors..
