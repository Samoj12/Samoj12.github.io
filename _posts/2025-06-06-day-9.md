what_i_learned: |
  Today, we still continue with our basics in the python programmin class, I learned how to create a list, I learned how to use a list to create some matrix questions and answer, I also used it to perform some mathematical operations. I also learned about dictionaries, apparently there is a difference between list and dictionaries although both are used to store collections of data, but differ in their structure and usage.
  The list is a collection of elements, each element is accessed by its index which are denoted by integer position starting 0(zero).
    Then dictionaries are collections of paired data where there is a key and a value, so when the key is called or printed, the result would be the value you assigned the key. In my opinion it is very similar to just creating a variable and just giving it a value.

  Unfortunately I thought I would be able to finish up the Kaggle python programming introductory course but I couldn't get passed some certain questions, I did ask my mentor and he helped me out, explaining it for me in a better way, but I still need to sit and figure it out. 
reflection: |
  Python programming has been exhausting honestly but I seem to be catching on, I just wished my understanding of this programming was faster, I still have some topic to revist and complete, hopefully I would be able to complete the introductory course and get my certificate over the weekend. Thanks to my teammates too, they also helped me to understand some concepts since they have better programming background than me.
