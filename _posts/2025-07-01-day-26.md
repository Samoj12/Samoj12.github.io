what_i_learned: |
  Today, I completed the prototype of the cancer prediction using gene expression data project we found yesterday, along side working on that project it gave me insights into what our model could have or use, I went on to research on the PCA method, LDA method and Multifactor logistic regression analysis technique. I was able to execute the PCA (Principal Component Analysis) method and the linear discriminant analysis, it took me quite a while to figure out the code part, half the day actually but I was able to come out with a good result another thing was trying to interpret the clustering graph analysis which the whole group had to come together to figure out the interpretation, Unfortunately a storm started close to when we were making progress, so we should be able to finish up the interpretation of the analysis and finally make a great breakthrough. I also helped Ato and Arpana debug and solve an issue in their code which was a similar problem I ran into as well, It felt good to know what I was doing, I felt like an advance coder for few seconds.

  Blockers today was struggling to get the coding part of the methods mainly for the LDA and PCA, Unfortunately I couldn't get the Multifactor logistic regression analysis technique to work, I will try it again tomorrow, hopefully I make progress.
 
reflection: |
  Today was a bit tensed due to the fact that we are at the half of the programme and considering the pace we were before it feels like we have drastically slowed down and everything we keep trying isn't giving us exactly what we want, it's quite frustrating but there must be a way and we shall find it, I feel my team mates are also feeling the pressure especially when the presentation is just 2 days away and we haven't had a practice run, tomorrow we should be able to do something like that.
