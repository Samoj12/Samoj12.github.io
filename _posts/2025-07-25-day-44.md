what_i_learned: |
  Today, we had a very interactive cohort experience with Dr. Chris Crawford, who is an Assistant Professor at the University of Alabama’s Department of Computer Science. He directs the Human-Technology Interaction Lab (HTIL). His research focuses on human-robot interaction and Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs), which we got to experience first hand today where we used muscle energy and a few instructions on the computer to control a small robot on wheel. We also applied the same concept on a drone that gets signals from the brain waves to fly and do some certain moves depending on the command we give it.

  No blockers.

reflection: |
  Toda was fun and very interesting, how I wish we could do more hands on practical things every cohort, it engages the participants and also sparks a fire of interest. Thanks to this program, I have been opened to a new experience in AI, Technology and Research. Hopefully I could do something in relation to all I have learn so far.
