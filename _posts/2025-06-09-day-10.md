what_i_learned: |
  Today, we just learn the introduction to machine learning, which is a set of technique to make computers better at doing things that humans (traditionally) can do better than machines. The information provided to the system improves the machine learning.
  I also learned about deep learning which is one area of machine learning. Deep learning are a set of techniques to extract knowledge from available data and use that knowledge to make decisions. Machine learning involves deep learning and mathematical models which are used to make predicitions.
  We were taught that spam filters are from E-mails are from machine learning.
  We also learnt about simple linear registration and Linear regression withmultiple variables.
  I also worked on some projects to build a module to tell if the prices of houses in some areas would be higher.
blockers: |
  Since we just started machine learning in python I am still trying to understand what it entails.
reflection: |
  I seem to be understanding the basics of python programming and how to apply them to exercises given by my mentor ,although I still have some issue in understanding the use of IF,ELSE,FOR and WHILE statements I was also able to complete my Kaggle python programming course and got a certificate which I would include at the end of the week progress presentation.
