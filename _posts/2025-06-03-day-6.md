what_i_learned: |
  Today, I learnt about the tools my group and I would be using to reach our desired result for the research, we would be making use of python, python machine learning and python pandas.
  We were also given a list of requirements we must reach for the research, the first being learning python through the use of W3 school, Kaggle and youtube videos on certain topics, mathematical statistics, Transcriptomics in genetics, how to data clean and analyze.
  Under python our mentor listed the neessary concepts to understand in python, which are user input, conditionals, loops, functions, lists, 2D lists, dictionaries, sets, OOP (Object oriented programming), and list comprehension.
  I also got to understand what Artificial Intelligence is, I thought it was the same as a computer which helps make work easier and faster but my faculty mentor and mentor corrected my line oif thinking, Artificial intelligence refers to the branch of computer science or technology that is able to simulate human learning, comprehension, problem solving, decision making, creativity and autonomy depending on how well the module or program it runs on has been trained well.
blockers: |
  The thought of having multiple steps to complete before being able to start thte real research programme, but it is needed, my mentor and faculty mentor are ready to assist me and guide me through to attain new knowledge and figure out this research.
reflection: |
  There is a lot to cover but with hard work and proper guidance I would have completed the essentials for pyhton before this week ends, the platforms I have been given would steer me in the right direction then I can move on to transcriptomic in genetics to understand the basics of that as well.
