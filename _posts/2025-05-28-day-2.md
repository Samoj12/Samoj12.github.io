what_i_learned: |
  I was able to meet my mentor and the facult supervisor of my project and discuss about what the project we would be working on, which is ( Application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) To Predict Genetic Biomarkers Of Brain Tumor From Transcriptomic Data Set),
  I was able to also start an introductory class on th basics of python, learning that it's a popular programming language used for very numerous programming tasks, I was able to compute some basic codes into replit which is progamming website where I could use python.
  I was also able to participate in activities that helped with the learning process like kahoot where answered questions on what we learned on python, head bandzzzz which was like a class activity just too cool everyone's head after such a day filled with learning.
  I also learnt how to edit some codes on Github to improve a website, I was given a template to also work on and improve to my own specification.
  I also learnt how to update my blog page too.

blockers: |
  No blockers Today, everything seems to be going well.

reflection: |
  I had learnt python before about 3 years from now and mostly forgotten everything since it was not my choice of career or my major but thanks to the class today for the introduction to python 101, my memory has been jogged and I also learnt a couple on new skills too.
