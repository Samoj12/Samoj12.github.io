what_i_learned: |
  Today we continue on the refining of our research paper and presentation, I thought we would have been able to do an overleaf workshop which would have made the writing process on Latex very fast and less problematic but I was able to get what I need from the help of a template i found and manus ai for assistance, we are almost done today I and Ato re-edited the introduction after Mr. Tije's and Dr. Richard's comment and corrections on wednesday, we would still present it to them just for confirmation that we are done and good to go. I reviewed Skylar methodology write up which was already perfect in my opinion but just needed a few re-wording. After that I added that to our overleaf. Now all that is left is the Results, Discussion and Conclusion.
blockers: |
  Trying to put in the methodology in the Overleaf as Latex, some symbol were giving unwanted functions in the write up.

reflection: |
  I and my group will still continue to work on our write up for the research paper and also present amongst ourselves for confidence boost and readiness for the final sympodium on the 31st, thanks to our team this research has been made quite possible tho it seemed tough but we've been able to make some great discoveries and to enlarge our knowledge of both technology and biology.
