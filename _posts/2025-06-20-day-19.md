what_i_learned: |
  Today, The faculty mentor came in to see our progress on the project, and he did alot of fine tuning which was needed, intially we wanted to create a module on some trained transcriptomic data in relation to genetic biomarkers of brain tumor, which would ultimately tell if a tumor is a tumor or if it is a false reading and just a regular tissue or cell, but our faculty mentor corrected us, so now our project won't be only telling us if a tumor is actually a tumor or false reading but it would also be classifying it as either benign or malignant, basically saying if it is cancerous in nature or non-cancerous which is honestly more efficient that just telling if it is a tumor or not, this would revolutionise brain tumor studies, prognosis, diagnosis and treatment. We would also be classifying the grades of these tumors to them either being malignant or benign because some of these brain tumor can be benign but left untreated, attended or undetected they might become malignant and have the ability to spread uncontrolably, we have Grade 1 to 4, 1 being the least harmful which could be addressed as benign and 4 being the most aggressive which could be addressed as malignant.

  There were no blockers today.
 
reflection: |
  Sadly it seems the whole team would be starting the whole project, research and gathering data sets because our collection of data wasn't complete which won't give our final desired outcome, So I and my team would be making research and finding data sets for the efficiency of this project during the weekend. Hopefully by Monday we would be back on track and have more data, and solid work. I would have to draft another introduction to relate with the modifications to the project.
