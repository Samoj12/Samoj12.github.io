what_i_learned: |
  Today immidiately I came in, I and Ato were asked to present our introduction for the research paper which we got feed back from the whole team, there were some of our statements that were not clear or precise, there were some with good statements and refrences to back them up, some were not linked with the correct refrence rather the refrence were not direct to our claim. With the help of Mr. Tije, our mentor and Dr. Richard, our high school teacher, Ato and I were able to identify our mistakes and areas of the introduction we needed to improve or correct. We should be able to finish up with the correction soon but we need to cite and read more research papers just to have solid evidence or info to back up our points, definitions, e.t.c.

  No blockers.

reflection: |
  We are finally leaving the coding aspect, meaning we are bringing the research to a close and just putting all our results and findings together for the finally presentation which coming up in a few weeks. For the next two days My team and I would be very focused on completting the paper before next week Monday so any final changes needed to be made would be next week, then we start preparation for the way we would present on the 31st of July for the final sympodium.
