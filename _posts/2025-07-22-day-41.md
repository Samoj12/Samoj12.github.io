what_i_learned: |
  Today, I worked on the discussion section on the research paper, I reviewed six papers today which are based on the genes we found from the graph reports we got from the result section,  I then summarized papers to about eight paragraphs, I still plan on editiing them just to give a solid discussion on our findings and results. I learnt more about these three genes - TIMP1, IGFBP3 and IGFBP2. TIMP1, in terms of genes, refers to the TIMP metallopeptidase inhibitor 1 gene, which encodes a protein that inhibits matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). TIMP1 is a member of the TIMP gene family, and its protein product is involved in regulating extracellular matrix turnover and cell growth. The gene IGFBP3 encodes the protein insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 3, which plays a crucial role in regulating the activity of insulin-like growth factors (IGFs). IGFBP2, or Insulin-like Growth Factor Binding Protein 2, is a gene that encodes a protein that binds to Insulin-like Growth Factors (IGFs). These IGFs play crucial roles in cell growth, differentiation, and survival, and IGFBP2 regulates their activity. IGFBP2 is known to be involved in both normal development and disease processes, including cancer and metabolic disorders.

  Everything feels and seems good, tomorrow would be exciting cause we have the 90 Second Project Commercial Video (Elevator Pitch) to execute, my group came up with a very interesting idea, we hope to pull it off. We should also be rounding up on the paper writing and presentation this week.
