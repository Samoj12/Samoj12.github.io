what_i_learned: |
  Today, I learnt some methods skylar used in the project but did not come out as we hoped: **Pearson Correlation**, **Spearman Correlation** and **Principal Component Analysis**, Pearson correlation is a statistical method to quantify the linear relationship between two continuous variables, Spearman correlation is a non-parametric statistical measure used in machine learning to assess the monotonic relationship between two variables, and Principal component analysis is a dimensionality reduction technique widely used in machine learning to simplify complex datasets while retaining essential information. Truthfully I grasped the concept of the pearson and spearman correlation, which actually gave us similar results, just that the spearman gave a slight difference in some genes that were malignant in pearson correlation were actually benign in spearman correlation. Skylar also kinda broke down the type of scaling she used for the statistical result, she used quantile normalization which basically compared data together. After break Tije (mentor) revisited an assignment he gave us last week on PANDAS in python, we all revisted the assignment solved it and got some questions answered, we would be finishing up the assignment over the weekend and will be verified on the following week.

  No blockers today.
 
reflection: |
  Today was okay, I basically stuck with skylar for the first half of the day trying to understand her side of the project which is the methodology, I needed to understand because I would also be giving a brief information on the methodology, she is definitely an experienced computer science major student and she has a simple way of explaining terms to me.
