what_i_learned: |
  Today, I learnt about normalization from Skylar, which is a crucial preprocessing step in data analysis and machine learning. It involves adjusting values measured on different scales to a common scale, often prior to averaging or other statistical operations. Basically it is giving a reasonable range to actually concise what ever statistical value is presented on a graph. I worked on the project slide presentation with Dr. Richard and Ato, we corrected some wrong statements in the slides, edited some aspects, explained what we meant by some certain terms like optimisation of data sets. Tije also showed us how to see, read and interpret a graphical statistical graph, it included the mean, median, standard variation. Tije also reviewed the presentation slide, gave us a few pointers on what we can include in the slide and what we leave out, how we can speak or explain on some certain points.
blockers: |
  The major blocker for the day was still the heat wave, the temperature was 97 degrees, it felt like I was in an oven.
 
reflection: |
  Today, I finally got my first pay from the program which honestly was rewarding and encouraging, now I and my group members have to finish up strong, with the paste we are at we would be able to finish up on schedule or even earlier, hopefully there won't be any set backs, the task that remains for me is to work with Ato on the final draft for the literature review and the introduction for the essay paper.
