what_i_learned: |
  Today, we met at the business building for the SAIRI cohort connect enrichment block for wednesday since thursday is a public holiday, we got an update on what are deliverables ought to be and look like, we also discussed about the presentation of the mid summer presentation, we also met with the highschool teachers assigned to each group, ours is Mr. Richard, he's actually a PhD holder in chemistry and he's field of study and position helps us in this research, especially the research paper. We also went back to some python basic coding because Mr. Richard has no coding or programming background but because of his extensive knowledge, he seemed to get the basics for now, we also tested our knowledge on PANDAS with a quiz, just a refresher of sort.

  There were no blockers today.
 
reflection: |
  Thanks to Mr. Richard joining the team he can help structure our research due to his extensive knowledge on research, he did a review of the introductory part of the research and gave some pointers about how we should address the main problem we are trying to solve rather than putting alot of background informataion.
