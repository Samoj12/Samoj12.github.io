what_i_learned: |
  Today, we had a meeting with other group teams in preparation for the presentation on friday and update on our team relationship with our high school teachers and mentors, I learnt how the presentation would go and what the demo video is supposed to contain, This morning was very calm and hill which in my opinion was needed because of the extremely hot weather and how much work load we've been doing probably because of the up coming presentation, also after lunch we shared a class room with group 12 which we both engaged in a pyhton, Api and pandas quiz challenge just see what we've learnt and just for a little competition. Our group obviously won but the other team just got two questions wrong. It was fun and also an avenue to learn, the website we used for the quiz was from code basic. I and Ato also took a look on the slide for the presentation and started editing while Arpana and Skylar kept on looking for data and cleaning the data. Then in general we have made progress but we would have to address the literature review again and the write up for the projects manuscript. Our high school teacher has been also a great help to the researching part and just organising any write up or presentation well, thanks to his prior knowledge of researching.

  No blockers today.

  Today was definitely calm, from the moring meet up with the other groups to just chat and catch up on how the project is supposed to be, the updating on our project, now we've gotten enough data to run a sample test on how far we've gotten, despite having a set back we managed to still cacth up to our schedule, all that is left is to keep going and then we also start the paper again due to the missing information from the very start of the project that was addressed last week friday by our faculty mentor.
