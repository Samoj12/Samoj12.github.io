what_i_learned: |
  Today, I tried looking for more datasets but unfortunately I could not find any tangible data, not like i did not find any, but the one's I found were probably in a different format, or they were incomplete in the sense of, they did not contain the grade level or the name of the type of cancer it was. Fortunately Arpana and Skylar were able to find more and clean it, they also merged it with the other clean data that we had. After cleaning and merging, we all tried to train our models with the newly merged datasets in hopes that we get a higher accuracy. Earlier in the morning I worked on Overleaf for the write up for the introduction, it was pretty good and straight forward especially when my mentor gave me a template to follow.

  No blockers today.
 
reflection: |
  Today was good, we finally made another breakthrough which was getting mor data for the training of our model, we are one step closer to finishing up this project, tho there are still parts we have to also research more about, differentiality in gene expression is a major one, then trying to seek out the top 10 most expressed genes when tumors become malignant and benign, either they become upregulated or downregulated. My mentor also gave me a new research paper to read which could probably help us in understanding the analysis of our results.
