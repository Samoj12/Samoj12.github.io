  Today, since yesterday we were able to get more datasets all that is left is to train our datasets using a model that would give us the highest accuracy in general and on our classification report. Everyone shared their findings and reports on various methods that was used such as Random forest, Decision Tree, e.t.c. My mentor Tije, gave me a method i haven't tried yet which was the t-SNE (t-distributed stochastic Neighbor Embedding) which is commonly used to visualize high-dimensional data in two dimension. In my case and according to my dataset, the points on the graph displayed from the t-SNE represented samples of either benign tumors or malignant brain tumors. The interpretation was also the very crucial part, I could observe multiple distinct clusters, especially among the green (Malignant) samples on the right, which suggests variability within malignant tumors, possibly different subtypes or gene expression patterns. I also observed in the middle-left region of the graph, Benign and Malignant samples are mixed, indicating that some benign samples share similar expression profiles with malignant ones — possibly borderline or early-stage tumors. This overlap could affect model performance and warrants deeper investigation. Mr. Tije also reviewed the model ANN (Artificial Neural Network) with the whole group on how we could changed the weight factor to get better accuracy which I did apply and it increased my accuracy by 2 percent but is still not enough I should be able to acquire an accuracy of 90 or over.

  Proper and simpler interpretation of the graph generated from the t-SNE.

  Today was good, we also made progress today on trying different machine learning models and modifying some of it like the ANN (Artificial Neural Network), going through a new technique our mentor found called the log 2FC which kind of understand a bit, it basically plays a central role in identifying and interpreting differential gene expression between experimental conditions—like disease vs. healthy, or treated vs. control.
