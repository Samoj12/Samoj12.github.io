what_i_learned: |
  Today we had a cohort connect which basically compromised of each individual and team where we applied the VARK test and Myers-Briggs test which basically told us each of our preferred learning style: visual, aural, read/write or kinesthetic and identifying personality preferences across four dichotomies.Extraversion (E) vs. Introversion (I): How you gain and direct energy
Sensing (S) vs. Intuition (N): How you gather and process information
Thinking (T) vs. Feeling (F): How you make decisions
Judging (J) vs. Perceiving (P): How you deal with structure and organization
