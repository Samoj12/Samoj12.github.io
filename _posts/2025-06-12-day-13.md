what_i_learned: |
  Today, we had our SAIRI Cohort Connect at the Earl Graves Business building where we gathered with the rest of the teams in the summer AI programme to connect, get updates on how each group's project has been going, to connect and relate with our peers just as a form of relaxation and resourcefulness,
  I learnt how to play a game, tho I did not participate but it was definitely fun and some what interlectually based, the name of the game is **TABOO**, basically it is a word-guessing game where you try to get your teammates to say a secret word without using any of the words listed on the card. This game shwoed some level of intelligence because you could find another way to describe some particular words, and it also task the people trying to guess the right word on how to connect clues together to get the right answer.
  I was also glad to be on the winning team.
  We were also taught on how to us overleaf which is a very valuable tool we would be using to write our research paper. It is a cloud based LaTex editor that enables collaborative writing and publishing of scientific documentations.
  And in the lab after thr cohort connect, we continued our literature review and gathering papers and research for references to our research paper.
  I am also looking into the construction of our introduction.
blockers: |
  Today's blocker was getting enough and accurate sources for the research paper, unfortunately we came across good research papers but they always lacked either a good explanation of the method or methodology they used or were about a different kind of cancer or tumor not necessarily refering to brain tumors.
reflection: |
  As we approach the week to do a mini presentation on what our research team has been able to accomplish, I feel a bit nervous but that is just a sign to prepare more and keep working hard, and the thursday cohort connect is something that I would be looking for because it is fun and a way to socialise, I personally could take a break from coding from time to time.
