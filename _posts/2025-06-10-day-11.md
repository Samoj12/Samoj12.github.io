what_i_learned: |
  Today, I learnt so much about literature review, which is the overview of current knowledge, identification of relevant and valuable theories and methods,and highlighting gaps in existing research that can inform future studies.
  Our mentor taught us about what is necessary to get for the literature review; Topic/Title of the paper, Year, DOI (Digital Object Identifier), Author's Name, Abstract, Method/Methodology and Results.
  Also in the articles, papers and resources we would be gathering for this project, we would be focusing on keywords or aspects that deal with Genetics, RNA Sequencing, Meningiomas, Glioblastomas, Secondary Brain Tumors, Micro Arrays that identify genes, Types/Categories of Brain Tumor.
  We also divided futher into Machine learning, and we were told the essential rules are; Importation of Data, Cleaning Of Data, Splitting Of Data (Into Training and Testing), Creation of Models, Making Predicitons, VAlidation of Module, and Evaluation (based on accuracy and precision).

  Since No blockers Today, Thankfully.
reflection: |
  Today was good day because I finaly got to an aspect I could understand and be really involved in. I am in the medical line so the whole biology research related topics really brings joy to me, although because of my current classification as a sophomore I haven't learnt some essential for genetics but this is an avenue to gain more knowledge and go beyond my peers.
