what_i_learned: |
  Today, I and team worked on finiding a more accurate model to predict our brain tumors and to determine if these braintumors are malignant or benign, I tried Logistic Regression, Decision Tree ,K-Nearest Neighbors, Gaussian Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine (SVC), Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Bagging Classifier, MLP Classifier, Gradient Boosting (Explicit) and ANN (Artificial Neural Network). With these models I tried running the codes severally but the accuracy was always off ranging from 69 percent to 79 percent, tho it is progress but it is still far from ready. We also finished up the presentation slide, we did a little practice amongst ourselve so we would have a bit of composure when go on stage to present to the whole institute.

  No blockers today.
 
reflection: |
  Honestly, time feels like it's flying but I guess it is because of the presentation tomorrow, it is very nerve wrecking but I would be doing some personal practice and run throughs before tomorrow, and I trust my team mates would also be doing the same. Hopefully we would be effeciently share our discoveries clearly.
