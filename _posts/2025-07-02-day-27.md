what_i_learned: |
  Today, I and team worked on finiding a more accurate model to predict our brain tumors and to determine if these braintumors are malignant or benign, I tried Logistic Regression, Decision Tree ,K-Nearest Neighbors, Gaussian Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine (SVC), Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Bagging Classifier, MLP Classifier, Gradient Boosting (Explicit), ANN (Artificial Neural Network)
