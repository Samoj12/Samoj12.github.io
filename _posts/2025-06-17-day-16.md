what_i_learned: |
  Today, I continued with my research on Brain Tumors, Genetic Biomarkes, and Literature Review. I learnt the difference between genetic testing and biomarker testing, Genetic Testing (this has to deal with inherited mutations), while Biomarkers Testing (this is the looking at the characteristics of the tumor which helps to make treatment decisions better, this can telll what is driving the cancer to grow and can also tell if it is somatic in nature or germline which means if it's passable to your offsprings.). Tije, Skylar, Arpana and Ato, whom have been the most experienced computer science major have been a big help to gathering resourceful paper which I could use to build a solid introduction. After my break I also learnt about the subsections of brain tumor which are tumors depending on where they started developing like the Gliomas originate from the glial cell, they can either be malignant or benign. Tije also briefly touched how to determine the dimension and shape of Matrixes on python using Google collab. I also came acroos research papers that were similar but were using DNA methylation, or were on a different kind of tumor/cancer like breast cancer which was the most I found. Tije also introduced me to Zotero which is used for proper citations and it has numerous formats including MLA and IEEE.

 Trying to do a proper citation with the IEEE format which is relatively new to me but I seem to be getting the hang of it now, I was only familiar with MLA.
 
reflection: |
  Everything seems to be coming along nicely but I have to hather up more research references and paper to back up this project and to present a valid report/result. I also have to go back to learning machine learning I seem to have relent, but thankfully Tije gave us an assignment to jog our memory, and we will be submitting that tomorrow.
