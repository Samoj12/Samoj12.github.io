what_i_learned: |
 Today, I learnt a better out line for the introduction with Ato, the outline we made included background and context, where the goal is to introduce brain tumors and their clinical burden, introduce genetic biomarkers and machine learning in health, Overview of brain tumors (types, grades, and challenges in diagnosis), importance of early detection and classification, role of genetics and transcriptomics in cancer biology, introduction to genetic biomarkers (e.g., upregulation/downregulation, diagnostic potential), brief explanation of machine learning in modern biomedicine, rationale for integrating machine learning with transcriptomic data for brain tumor analysis. The Second point would be Problem Statement, where the goal would be to define the research problem and its significance, limitations of traditional diagnostic approaches (e.g., imaging, histopathology), challenges in identifying meaningful biomarkers manually, need for AI-driven methods to uncover patterns in large genomic datasets. The third point would be objectives and research where the goal is to state your aims clearly, based on the overview you provided, list the goals you've already written, rephrased as formal research objectives
blockers: |
  No blockers today.
 
reflection: |
  Today was okay, I just mainly focused on trying to refine and fine tune the previous introduction for the research paper, I also went back to some sources to confirm some statements and along the way Ato found some new source that supports our research and also gives in depth to artificial intelligent application to brain tumor research.
